Problem:
Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! 
Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. 
Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score. 
If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

Answer:
select 
    ha.hacker_id, ha.name 
from 
    hackers as ha  
    join submissions as su on su.hacker_id = ha.hacker_id 
    join challenges as ch on su.challenge_id = ch.challenge_id
    join difficulty as di on di.difficulty_level = ch.difficulty_level and su.score = di.score 
group by
    ha.hacker_id, ha.name
having
    count(ch.challenge_id) > 1
order by
    count(ch.challenge_id) desc, ha.hacker_id
