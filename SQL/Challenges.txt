Problem:
Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created,
then exclude those students from the result.

Answer:
with 
    table1
as
    (
    select
        ha.hacker_id,
        ha.name,
        count(ch.challenge_id) as qtt
    from
        hackers as ha
            join
        challenges as ch
        on  ch.hacker_id = ha.hacker_id
    group by
        ha.hacker_id, ha.name
    )
select 
    *
from
    table1
where
    qtt not in
    (
    select 
        qtt
    from 
        table1
    group by
        qtt
    having
        count(1) > 1 and qtt < 
        (
        select
            max(qtt) from table1
        )
    )
    order by
        qtt desc, hacker_id asc
