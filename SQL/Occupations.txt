Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. 
The output column headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Answer:
with table1 as 
    (select name, occupation, row_number() over (partition by occupation order by name) as rn from occupations)
select 
    max(case when occupation = 'Doctor' then name else null end), 
    max(case when occupation = 'Professor' then name else null end), 
    max(case when occupation = 'Singer' then name else null end), 
    max(case when occupation = 'Actor' then name else null end) from table1 group by rn
