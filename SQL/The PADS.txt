Generate the following two result sets:

1. Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, 
immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses).
For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

2. Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. 
Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:

There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. 
If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Answer: 
1. select concat(name, concat("(", left(occupation, 1), ")")) from occupations order by name;
2. select concat("There are a total of ", count(occupation)), concat(lower(occupation),"s.") from occupations 
group by occupation order by count(occupation) asc, occupation;
