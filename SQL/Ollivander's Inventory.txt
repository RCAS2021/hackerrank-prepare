Problem:
Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age. 
Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. 
If more than one wand has same power, sort the result in order of descending age.

Answer:
select
    wa.id,
    wp.age,
    wa.coins_needed,
    wa.power
from
    wands as wa
        join
    wands_property as wp
    on wp.code = wa.code
where
    wp.is_evil = 0
        and
    wa.coins_needed =
    (
    select
        min(sub.coins_needed) 
    from 
        wands as sub
    where
        sub.code = wa.code
            and
        sub.power = wa.power
    ) 
order by 
    wa.power desc, wp.age desc
