Relation R(A,B,C) has the following tuples:

A B C
1 2 3
4 2 3
4 5 6
2 5 3
1 2 6

and relation S(A,B,C) has the following tuples:

A B C
2 5 3
2 5 4
4 5 6
1 2 3

The differences (R-S) is computed and the following tuple is found to be present in the result. Assume that the schema of the result is (A,B,C).

4, b, c

Answer: 2, 3 <= There are two tuples which start with 4 in R and one in S. The first tuple in R = 4, 2, 3 and the second = 4, 5, 6. The tuple in S = 4, 5, 6. The difference between them (R-S)
is the tuple that is not in both, so (R-S) which starts with an 4 = 4, 2, 3.
