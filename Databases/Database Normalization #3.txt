A database used by a collegeâ€™s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. 
We have information for each STUDENT (such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.). 
In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously while a subject is studied by several students. We need to capture this many-to-many relationship in our database. 
From the above information, what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?

Answer: 3.
On the Second normal form, create separate tables for sets of values that apply to multiple records and relate these tables with a foreign key.

Example:
Student 
*Student-ID* | *Name* | *Enrollment* | *Course*
1            | Joe    | 2020-01-02   | Mathematics
1            | Joe    | 2020-01-02   | Science
2            | John   | 2020-06-15   | Mathematics
3            | Cyn    | 2020-06-16   | Science

Course
*Course-ID* | *Name*      | *Instructor*
1           | Mathematics | Smith
2           | Science     | Jones

Becomes:
Student 
*Student-ID* | *Name* | *Enrollment*
1            | Joe    | 2020-01-02
2            | John   | 2020-06-15
3            | Cyn    | 2020-06-16

Course
*Course-ID* | *Instructor*
1           | Smith
2           | Jones

Registration
*Student-ID* | *Course-ID*
1            | 1
1            | 2
2            | 1
3            | 2
