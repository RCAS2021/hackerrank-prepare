A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. 
Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. 
What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form?

Answer: 10, to transition to the 3NF it is needed to eliminate fields that don't depend on the key.
The tables have only 2 columns, one is the key and the other is a non-key, so the tables are already on the 3NF.
