Relation R(A,C) has the following tuples:

A : C
3,3
16,4
12,3
3,15
27,1

Relation S(B,C,D) has the following tuples:

B : C : D
50,1,6
1,55,8
4,3,9

The following tuple is in the result of the natural join between R and S where tuples are structured as (A,B,C,D):

27, X, Y, Z

Answer: X = 50, Y = 1, Z = 6 <= Find the A:C where there is a 27 = (27,1). Then, on S(B, C, D), the tuple where C = 1 (A(27,1) = A(A,C)), returning the tuple 50(B), 1(C), 6(D)
