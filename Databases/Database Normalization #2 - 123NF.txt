A particular database is normalized to satisfy a particular level of normalization (either 1NF or 2NF or 3NF). 
One of the tables contains, among other fields, a column for the City and a column for the Zip Code. 
Assuming that there is a many-to-one mapping between the set of Zip Code(s) and City, we may conclude that the database is definitely NOT in NF form. 
What is the integer x (1, 2, or 3)? 

Answer: 3NF.
On the third normal form, fields that don't depend on the key are eliminated
